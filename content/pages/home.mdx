      i'm jh, when i was a kid and asking my mom what i should do she used to
      answer:


      *make your own experience*


      and that's what i'm doing with this blog (and life in general)


      so here you'll find me trying to experience life trough writing, poetry,
      photography, essays.


      this intangible space is one of my verses. might not be the best or even a
      good one. but it has the merit of not fighting for greatness and of
      existing.

      "We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write
      poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is
      filled with passion. sustain life. Poetry, beauty, romance, love, these
      are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman, "O me! O life!... of
      the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the
      faithless... of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O
      me, O life?" Answer. That you are here - that life exists, and identity;
      that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. That the
      powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse
      be?"
